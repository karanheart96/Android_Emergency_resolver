# Android_Emergency_resolver
This is an android app that helps people in terms of emergency situations.
I have included the src file of the android app.The app is written in kotlin.
1)Add the name and phone numbers of the people you wish to contact in terms of emergency.
2)Once all the information is included , you can test the app about how it works.
WORKING:-
3)Click on the microphone icon.It listens for the word "Help" and once it recognizes it starts sending your coordinates(lat,long) to the people you already included in step 1.
4)It keeps sending sms to the people you included for every 2 seconds,but this time constarint can be changed according to your needs in the code.
5)Even if the app is closed or minimized the app starts a service and continues sending the coordinates to the mentioned people.
6)This is somewhat similar to the emergency sos system of Apple iphones but the location keeps updating based on your gps location so the people can know exactly where you are with respect to time.
7)A local database is included with the app so that you need not worry that each time you have to enter the information about the phone numbers each time the app starts.
8)Technologies used-SMS,Database,GPS,Service,Speech Recognition.
